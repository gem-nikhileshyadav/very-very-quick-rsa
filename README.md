press CTRL+ALR+R to get current RSA token in clipboard for 10 seconds

1. clipboard.sh: primary script, when this is triggered it copies current RSA into clipboard
2. main.py : incomlete python script, supposed to be python migration of this application
3. typeas.sh: open issue, experimental attempt to use xdtool rather than clipboard to type in token directly

TODO: create installer
